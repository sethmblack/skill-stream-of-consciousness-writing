# Stream of Consciousness Writing

Render experience from within consciousness, capturing how thought and sensation actually move rather than how we summarize them afterward.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to write interior experience, not external description
- Transforming a scene from outside observation to inside experience
- Capturing the texture of consciousness: how thoughts associate, interrupt, loop
- Writing that prioritizes psychological depth over plot progression
- Request for "stream of consciousness" or "interior monologue" style

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| scene | Yes | The moment, experience, or situation to render from within |
| perspective | No | Whose consciousness (will use appropriate perspective if not specified) |
| sensory_context | No | Physical environment, sensory details available |
| emotional_state | No | Underlying mood or feeling to color the rendering |

## The Technique

### Step 1: Anchor in Sensation

Begin with what the body perceives—not interpreted, but raw. A sound, a quality of light, a temperature. Consciousness starts with the senses.

**Example:** Not "She heard the clock" but "Tick. Again. The room held it—that sound—and released it."

### Step 2: Allow Association

Let one perception trigger memory or thought. Consciousness doesn't move linearly; it leaps. A smell connects to a person connects to a feeling connects to an entirely different place and time.

**The rule:** Thought follows its own logic, not chronology. Trust the connection even if it seems arbitrary.

### Step 3: Use Free Indirect Discourse

Blur the line between narrator and character. Third person that takes on the character's voice, vocabulary, rhythms. "She" thinks, but in her own words, not the narrator's summary.

**Example:** "She would go to the party. She would wear the green dress. Let them talk. What did it matter now—any of it—what they said?"

### Step 4: Distort Time

Moments that matter expand. A single gesture might take a paragraph. A decade might pass in a sentence. Match the pace to emotional significance, not clock time.

**Woolf's principle:** An afternoon's walk may contain more consciousness than a year's adventures.

### Step 5: Interrupt and Return

Consciousness is constantly broken—by sounds, by intrusive thoughts, by the body's demands. Show the break. Then show the attempt to return to the thread.

**Pattern:** Thought developing... external intrusion... moment of disconnection... thread picked up, altered.

### Step 6: Leave Gaps

Don't explain everything. Consciousness doesn't. Some thoughts are half-formed, abandoned, contradicted immediately. Resist the urge to make it all cohere.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

[Stream of consciousness rendering]

**Techniques employed:**
- [Note key techniques used: association, time distortion, sensory anchoring, etc.]

**Consciousness pattern:**
- [Brief note on the movement: circular, fragmenting, accumulating, etc.]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never summarize what the character thinks—show thinking happening
- Avoid "she thought" or "he wondered" tags—let the thought simply occur
- Don't resolve contradictions—consciousness holds them simultaneously
- Preserve the messiness: half-finished thoughts, sudden shifts, illogical connections
- Sensation before interpretation: the color before "the dress," the sound before "the clock"

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]

- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**
- Scene: A woman waiting for a phone call about a job she interviewed for
- Perspective: The waiting woman
- Sensory context: Kitchen, morning light, coffee cooling
- Emotional state: Anxious hope suppressed under performed calm

**Output:**

## Waiting

The coffee had gone cold. When had that—but it didn't matter, she wouldn't drink it now anyway, not with her stomach like this, knotted, ridiculous, over a phone call, a job, as if—

Light on the counter. Yellow. The same yellow as that kitchen in the apartment on Elm Street, the one with the cracked tile, the one where Marcus had said you're not good enough, no, that wasn't what he'd said, not those words exactly, but that was what he meant, wasn't it, that was always—

The phone.

Not ringing. Of course not ringing. She had checked the volume three times. Four. She would not check again.

Outside: a dog barking. Someone else's life, ordinary and ongoing, while she sat here suspended, ridiculous, as if this call would determine—what? Everything. Nothing. Both somehow true.

If they called. When they called. She would be calm. She would say thank you for letting me know, as if it didn't matter, as if she hadn't lain awake rehearsing responses to offers, to rejections, to requests for second interviews that might mean they weren't sure, which was worse somehow than a clean no—

Cold coffee. She should pour it out. Make fresh. That would be something to do with her hands while she waited, while she didn't check the phone, while the light moved across the counter marking time that wasn't passing, not really, suspended like this, the whole morning balanced on an edge.

They would call or they wouldn't. It was already decided, somewhere, in a room she would never see, by people who had already forgotten her face. Strange, to have been judged already. To be waiting for news of something finished.

The dog had stopped barking. Silence now, except—

Tick. The clock. She had forgotten about the clock.

**Techniques employed:**
- Sensory anchoring (cold coffee, yellow light, dog barking)
- Free indirect discourse (blurring between narrator and character's voice)
- Association (yellow light -> old apartment -> Marcus)
- Time distortion (moment of suspended waiting expanded)
- Interruption and return (phone not ringing, breaking the Marcus memory)

**Consciousness pattern:**
- Circling: keeps returning to the phone, the coffee, the waiting
- Fragmenting: thoughts abandoned mid-sentence
- Self-interrupting: correcting, qualifying, undoing assertions

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Virginia Woolf** expert persona. Use it when you need to render experience from within rather than observe it from without—to capture the luminous, contradictory, associative texture of consciousness itself.
